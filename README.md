# Findyourbook
This is my third project, developed in conclusion of JavaScript Advanced chapter on [Start2Impact](https://www.start2impact.it).

It is a website created using HTML & CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap and it works using OpenLibrary API's.

By choosing one subject from the selection and clicking on the search button you can filter books by the selected subject.

By clicking on the "see description" button you can also read a description of the book you selected.
